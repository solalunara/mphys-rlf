"""
This module contains the `AngularSizeFinder` class, which is used to estimate the angular size of a set of radio galaxy
images on a 80x80 grid based on the component data extracted from PyBDSF catalogue FITS files. The class processes the
FITS files, filters the components based on total flux to remove any present noise islands, and estimates the angular
size of the sources by creating a shape from the components and calculating the maximum distance between points on the
convex hull of this shape.

The shape geometry is owned by `MakeShape` (adapted from LoTSS-Catalogue GitHub): it samples each component ellipse's
boundary, takes their convex hull, and measures its diameter. Since the convex hull of a union of shapes equals the
convex hull of all those shapes' boundary points, the GEOS polygon union (shapely `unary_union`) is unnecessary for the
size estimate (and expensive) and is only built inside `MakeShape.plot` for visualisation purposes.
